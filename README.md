## 📌 Overview

This portfolio was built as part of a React course to demonstrate component-based architecture and styling, while maintaining clean code and accessibility standards.
The site includes information about me, my tech stack, my projects, and a way to get in touch.

## 💻 Tech Stack used

- **React** (Vite)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **CSS / Responsive Design**
- **HTML5** (semantic markup, accessibility)

## 🤯 Learnings

Number one lesson during this project: realizing GitHub doesn't always recognize changes to lower/uppercase in file-, and folder-names. This caused a lot of trouble when deploying to Netlify -> Netlify couldn't build site because import pathways were "wrong". Looking at my local copy everything looked good, but on GitHub it didn't match. After many hours researching i found the problem and had to change my local copy to match the GitHub version (in case sensitivity) to make it work. Lesson learned: make sure to name files and folders correctly from scratch, to avoid renaming issues later on.
